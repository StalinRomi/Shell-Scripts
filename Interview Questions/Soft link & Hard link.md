## Hard link

If we want to protect an important file from **additional deletion**, we can create a Hard link. This creates a copy of file.

### To create it -> ln file name Hard_link name

## Soft link

Soft links are used to **refer / point** to original file.

### To create it -> ln -s file name Soft_link name
